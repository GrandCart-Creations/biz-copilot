**This enables:**

---

### **Option B: Polish & Test Current Features**

**Time:** 1 week

## 💡 My Recommendation

**Build Option A (Team Management) next.**

**Why:**
1. **Critical gap** - You can't test multi-user features without it
2. **Foundation for everything else** - Needed before proper testing
3. **Quick win** - Can be built in 1-2 weeks
4. **Enables real-world testing** - You can invite actual users

**Then:**
- Week 3-4: Polish & test (Option B)
- Week 5-6: Build Income module (Option D)
- Week 7+: Onboarding flow (Option C)
