### Step 2: Update Repository Description (1 minute)

1. **Still in Settings** or go to repository main page
   - Look for "Description" field (also available on main repo page)
   
2. **Update Description**
   - Change to: **"Intelligent business management platform for Dutch entrepreneurs and small businesses"**
   - Or shorter version: **"Your Business Co-Pilot - Intelligent business management for Dutch entrepreneurs"**
   
3. **Add Topics/Tags** (helps with discoverability)
   - Click "Add topics" on main repository page
   - Suggested tags:
     - `business-management`
     - `expense-tracker`
     - `invoice-management`
     - `dutch-entrepreneurs`
     - `firebase`
     - `react`
     - `small-business`
     - `btw-compliance`
     - `enterprise-security`

### Step 3: Update Repository Website (Optional - 1 minute)

1. **On Main Repository Page** or in Settings
   - Find "Website" field
   - Add: `https://biz-copilot.nl`
   - This appears at the top of your repository

---

### Step 4: Update README Badge URLs (Optional - 2 minutes)

If you have any badges in your README that reference the old repository name, update them:

Old URLs will have: `/expense-tracker-app/`
New URLs should have: `/biz-copilot/`

Example badges to update:
- Build status badges
- Coverage badges
- Version badges
- License badges

---

### Step 5: Rename Local Directory (Optional - 1 minute)

To match the new repository name:

```bash
cd /Users/gc-mac2018/Desktop
mv expense-tracker-app biz-copilot
cd biz-copilot
```

This is purely organizational and doesn't affect Git functionality.

## üîÑ What Happens After Renaming?

### Automatic Redirects
GitHub will redirect traffic from old URLs to new ones:
- `github.com/GrandCart-Creations/expense-tracker-app` ‚Üí `github.com/GrandCart-Creations/biz-copilot`
- This works for git operations too (clone, fetch, pull, push)

### What You Need to Update
1. ‚úÖ Local git remote (command provided above)
2. ‚úÖ Any CI/CD configurations that reference the repo URL
3. ‚úÖ Any documentation linking to the old repository
4. ‚úÖ Package.json homepage URL (already done! ‚úÖ)
5. ‚úÖ Firebase or other deployment configurations
