## Development Commands

### Local Development
```bash
npm run dev
```
Starts the Vite development server (usually on `http://localhost:5173`)

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```
Creates an optimized production build in the `dist/` directory

### Preview Production Build
```bash
npm run preview
```
Locally preview the production build

### Deploy to Firebase
```bash
firebase deploy
```
Deploys the application to Firebase Hosting

### Deploy Hosting Only
```bash
firebase deploy --only hosting
```
Deploys only the hosting configuration (faster for frontend-only changes)

## Current Focus

**Landing Page Deployment**: The current priority is deploying the professional Dutch landing page to biz-copilot.nl. This includes:

- Professional branding with the new logo
- Dutch language content targeting entrepreneurs
- Clear value proposition and call-to-action
- Setup guides for getting started with the platform

## Recent Changes

Based on recent commits:
- Added professional Dutch landing page
- Replaced all placeholder icons with professional Biz-CoPilot logo
- Added setup guides and configuration documentation
- Completed logo and branding assets

## Important Notes

1. **Project Renaming**: The project was renamed from `expense-tracker-app` to `biz-copilot`. Some legacy references may still exist in:
   - Firebase project ID
   - Configuration files
   - Comments in code

2. **Branding Consistency**: Always use the gradient color scheme (Indigo → Purple → Pink) for brand consistency. The logo files are available in multiple formats and should be used consistently across the application.

3. **Target Market**: Content and features should be tailored for Dutch entrepreneurs. Keep the user experience simple and focused on business management needs.

4. **Firebase Configuration**: The Firebase project ID remains `expense-tracker-prod-475813` despite the rebranding. This is intentional to maintain deployment continuity.

## Getting Started for Development

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure Firebase**: Ensure you have the correct Firebase configuration in your environment variables or configuration files.

3. **Run Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Make Changes**: Edit files in `src/` directory. Vite will hot-reload changes automatically.

5. **Build and Deploy**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   firebase deploy
   ```
