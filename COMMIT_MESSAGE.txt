- Confirmed proper financial account balance updates
- Verified automatic income record creation from paid invoices
- Tested ledger entry creation for double-entry bookkeeping
- All data connections tested and working correctly

Documentation:

- Added deployment instructions (DEPLOY_AI_FUNCTIONS.md)
- Created OpenAI API key setup guide (GET_OPENAI_API_KEY.md)
- Added AI Engine status and readiness documentation
- Created data flow integrity test documentation

Deployment:
- Deployed enhanced AI Command Center UI to biz-copilot.nl
- All frontend changes live and ready for testing
- Functions ready for deployment (requires OpenAI API key setup)

Technical Details:
- Enhanced aiEngine.js with better response formatting
- Improved aiQueryBuilder.js for natural language parsing
- Updated AICommandCenter.jsx with rich response display
- Fixed AppHeader.jsx z-index for proper layering
- Updated ExpenseTracker.jsx scroll behavior

Next Steps:
- Set OpenAI API key: firebase functions:secrets:set OPENAI_API_KEY
- Deploy functions: firebase deploy --only functions
- Begin AI Engine testing with real queries

This commit completes Phase 7A: AI Engine Core enhancements and prepares
the system for comprehensive AI Engine testing and deployment.
